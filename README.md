2. Push yourself — integrate with a new API!


## Go, you!
First of all, congratulations on making it all the way to the end! You're a champion! Now, for your
final challenge...

This lesson covers your final assignment. It is supposed to be your magnum opus — a culmination of
all the skills you've learned so far. It's going to be a tough one, but you'll make it through.
You're a _warrior_.


## Overview
This assignment is super open-ended when it comes to the actual content. You are free to create
whatever you'd like, as long as it incorporates most of what you've learned in this course. If
you don't have any inspiration at the moment, here are a couple of ideas:

- Twitter client
- Imgur browsing app
- Reddit feed
- Typeracer game
- Crossword puzzle


## Requirements
- The code should be written in ES2015 as much as possible
- Feel free to split things up in multiple files, since this will be a relatively big project.
Splitting up your files will make things more manageable. 
- Your app should have an interface in HTML for users to interact with
- Any dynamic data in your application (tweets, for example) should be rendered to the DOM using some
kind of JS templating
- Your app should have some minimal styling: feel free to stick to a framework, but if you want to
write (additional) CSS yourself, go for it!
- Fetch some data from a remote source. If you're creating a Twitter or Reddit feed, getting the data
should be relatively straight-forward. If you are creating an app that does not really have a use
for fetching remote data, try storing your data locally and fetch the JSON file. An example of local
data would be the answers and solutions to your crossword puzzle. You can do this using `fetch()`,
jQuery's AJAX methods, or any other method you prefer.

Go wild! These are only the basic requirements — you're free to add on as much stuff as you'd like.
For example, it might be fun to take a look at BaaS (Backend as a Service) platforms that allow you
to store data in the cloud instead of creating your own server.


## Assessment

### Be prepared to
1. Explain your code. You might be asked why you chose to solve things a certain way, or why you
chose a certain library or code structure.
2. Refactor/reorganize your code.
3. Build out extra basic functionality.

### What to expect from the pairing session
- Try to talk through your process clearly, using technical terms you know as precisely as possible.
- If you make a mistake, correct yourself! We all mess up — shake yourself off and keep plugging.
- Trust your instincts.
- Trust us.
- Think on your feet. Feel free to look things up while you're pairing with us.
- Explain the details — we like details!
- You're going to learn a ton during the pairing session. We'll give you pointers and ways to
improve your code. That doesn't mean that your code was _wrong_, just that (as with all of our code),
it can be improved. Ask us questions if you don't understand (or even if you think you might not)!

### What won't happen
- You won't be told you're ever wrong
- You won't be yelled at, belittled, or scolded
- You won't be put on the spot without support
- There's nothing you can do to instantly fail or blow it.

# Building a client-side application in JavaScript

## Objectives

1. Demonstrate mastery of material in this course
2. Push yourself â€” integrate with a new API!

## Outline

This lab should be very open-ended. Students can choose basically any
project that can be implemented client-side (and they are welcome to read
up on integrating with a BaaS like Firebase for "extra credit").

We should give students some ideas, including an imgur-browsing app, a
Twitter client, etc.

We want to come up with a list of criteria that the assessment must pass.
Here's an example from the HTML/CSS course: https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/html-css-assessment

Basic requirements will of course include some kind of interface, DOM
interactivity, AJAX requests (meant broadly; students should feel free to use
`fetch()`), etc.
